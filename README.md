# Arbiter
This is the repository of the Arbiter Fake News Detection system, as created for an undergraduate project.

Arbiter **should only be used for research purposes**, as there already exist far more reliable automated fake news detection systems, and as such it is relatively inaccurate.

## Setup
You will need to download and extract several datasets:
* IBM Debater Claims and Evidence - EMNLP'2015
* Sentiment140
* FakeNewsNet (PolitiFact articles only)

Then please read Manual.docx for further setup information.
